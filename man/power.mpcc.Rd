\usage{
power.mpcc(
  n = NULL,
  OR,
  p2,
  v,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  power = NULL,
  M = 1,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "one.sided"),
  tol = .Machine$double.eps^0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of matched pairs needed for study}

\item{OR}{Odds Ratio (ie, the "ratio worth detecting")}

\item{p2}{probability a control has a history of exposure}

\item{v}{measure of concordance (of exposure) in the case and control samples. 
\code{v} = 1 if and only if the matching variables are not associated with exposure in the case and control samples.}

\item{sig.level}{significance level (Type I error probability)}

\item{power}{power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)}

\item{M}{number of controls per case (default = 1)}

\item{alternative}{one- or two-sided test. Can be abbreviated.}

\item{tol}{numerical tolerance used in root finding, the default providing (at least) four significant digits. 
Root finding refers to \code{\link[stats]{uniroot}}, which is used to find sample size given power.}

\value{
Object of class "power.htest", a list of the arguments (including the computed one) augmented with 
method and note elements.

\description{
Compute the power of the Matched-Pairs Case-Control Odds Ratio Test, or determine parameters to obtain a target power.
}
\details{
Exactly one of the parameters n and power must be passed as NULL, and that parameter is determined from the others.

When pre-study information on concordance is limited, Fleiss and Levin (1988) recommend using a relatively 
large value of \code{v}, such as 2.5.

Sample size estimates for M >=1 can be overestimated when the probability is small that a sample control 
has a history of exposure.
