\title{Cause-Deleted Life Table (CDLT) for a given year}
\usage{
cdlt(group, all.deaths, cause.deaths, pop, radix = 1e+05)
}
\arguments{
\item{group}{The age group vector as integer. For example, 0, 1, 5, ... where 0 indicates birth to one year, 
1 indicates age 1 to age 5, and so forth. See data used with example below.}

\item{all.deaths}{The number of deaths from all causes for each age group as a numeric vector.}

\item{cause.deaths}{The number of deaths from a particular cause for each age group as a numeric vector.}

\item{pop}{The population for each age group as a numeric vector.}

\item{radix}{The number of individuals in the OLT birth cohort. Typically set to a large number like 100,000.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with \code{length(group)} rows and 8 columns:
\describe{
\item{group}{Age group}
\item{qj}{conditional probability of dying }
\item{pj}{conditional probability of surviving}
\item{lxj}{number of survivors to age x}
\item{dj}{number of deaths in age group}
\item{Lj}{number of person years in age group}
\item{Txj}{Number of person years after age x}
\item{exj}{Life expectancy at age x}
}
}
\description{
Construct a cause-deleted life table for a given year. The cause-deleted life table (CDLT)
is constructed just like an ordinary life table (OLT), except the cause-deleted death rate
is used in place of the annual death rate.
}
\examples{
## Example 13.4

## save ordinary life table
olt.out <- with(males, 
                olt(group = age.group, deaths = deaths.all, pop = pop))
                
## save cause-deleted life table for circulatory disease
circ.cdlt <- with(males, 
                  cdlt(group = age.group, all.deaths = deaths.all, 
                       cause.deaths = circ.deaths, pop = pop))
 
## save multiple decrement life table for circulatory disease
circ.mdlt <- with(males,
                  mdlt(group = age.group, all.deaths = deaths.all, 
                       cause.deaths = circ.deaths, pop = pop))
                       
## Table 13.8 calculations for circulatory disease

## Circulatory disease accounts for 40.09\% of deaths
circ.mdlt[1,"lkxj"]/olt.out[1,"lxj"] * 100

## life expectancy (at birth) for those due to die of circulatory disease 
## is 77.7 years
circ.mdlt[1,"ekxj"]

## Eliminating circulatory diseases as a cause of death would increase 
## overall life expectancy by 6.06 years
circ.cdlt[1,"exj"] - olt.out[1,"exj"]

## As a result of eliminating circulatory disease, the probability that 
## a member of the MDLT cohort will survive to age 65 increases by about 13\%
(circ.cdlt[circ.cdlt$group==65,"lxj"] - olt.out[olt.out$group==65,"lxj"]) / 
  circ.mdlt[1,"lkxj"] * 100
 
## Eliminating circulatory diseases as a cause of death would increase 
## the life expectancy of those due to die of this cause by 15.12 years
(olt.out[1,"lxj"] * (circ.cdlt[1,"exj"] - olt.out[1,"exj"])) / circ.mdlt[1,"lkxj"]
