\title{Hazard Ratio Test of association for survival data with k strata}
\usage{
k.hazard.ratio.test(
  time,
  status,
  exposure,
  strata,
  Wald = TRUE,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{a numeric vector of survival times.}

\item{status}{a numeric vector of censoring indicators, with 0 = censored and
1 = dead.}

\item{exposure}{a factor vector with at least two levels indicating exposure. The
first level is assumed to be the exposed condition.}

\item{strata}{a factor vector with at least two levels indicating strata.}

\item{Wald}{a logical indicating whether to use the Wald or Likelihood Ratio 
Test. Default is TRUE. Only used in the 2 by 2 by K case.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the returned confidence 
interval. Must be a single number between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95. Only used in the 2 by 2 by K case.}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"htest"} containing the following 
  components: 
  \describe{ 
  \item{statistic}{The chi-square test statistic.} 
  \item{parameter}{The degrees of freedom of the approximate chi-squared distribution of the test statistic.}
  \item{p.value}{The p-value of the test.} 
  \item{estimate}{Common hazard ratio estimate. Only present in the 2 by 2 by K case.} 
  \item{null.value}{The null common hazard ratio, which is currently set to 1. Only present in the 2 by 2 by K case.} 
  \item{alternative}{A character string describing the alternative hypothesis. Currently only "two.sided". Only present in the 2 by 2 by K case.} 
  \item{method}{A character string indicating the method employed.} 
  \item{data.name}{A character string giving the name of the data.} }
}
\description{
Performs a test of the null that the hazard ratio between \emph{k} strata is 1.

## Example 10.14
with(breast.survival, 
     k.hazard.ratio.test(time = time, status = status, 
                         exposure = receptor.level, strata = stage))
                         
## LR Test 
with(breast.survival, 
     k.hazard.ratio.test(time = time, status = status,
                         exposure = receptor.level, strata = stage, 
                         Wald=FALSE))
                         
## Example 10.18 - polychotomous exposure
with(breast.survival, 
     k.hazard.ratio.test(time = time, status = status,
                         exposure = stage, strata = receptor.level))
