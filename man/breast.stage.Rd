\description{
A random sample of 199 female breast cancer patients who registered with the Northern Alberta Breast 
Cancer Registry in 1985. Entry into the cohort was restricted to women with either stage I, II, or III 
disease. Of the 199 subjects in the cohort, seven died of a cause other than breast cancer. These 
individuals were dropped from the analysis. Data are provided in different subsets and formats 
throughout Newman: Table 4.5(a), page 99 (\code{\link{breast}}); 
Table 5.3, page 126 (\code{\link{breast.receptor}}); 
Table 5.10, page 140 (\code{\link{breast.stage}}); 
Table 9.1, page 175 (\code{\link{breast.survival}})

## Convert to data frame for logistic regression, Example 15.1

## Fit model (15.5, page 300)
m1 <- glm(cbind(dead,alive)  ~ receptor.level + stage, data=dat, family = binomial)
summary(m1)
exp(confint(m1)) # confidence intervals

## to get confidence intervals presented in Table 15.3
exp(coef(m1) + t(matrix(c(-1,1),nrow=2) \%*\% (qnorm(0.975) * summary(m1)$coefficients[,2])))

## predicted probability of death during 5-year period follow-up 
## for patient with receptor.level="low" and stage="II"
